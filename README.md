# RPG Census

[RPG Census][rpg-census] generates names for your roleplaying game characters using data from the United States census. The names are chosen completely at random, which means that *James Smith* is just as likely be generated as *Elden Aalderink*. There is a tremendous diversity in American demographics, making RPG Census suitable for not only modern-day settings but also science fiction and even fantasy.

## The data
RPG Census uses data from the 1990 U.S. census consisting of approximately 5,000 first names and almost 90,000 surnames. This data is freely [available at the United States Census Bureau's website][census].

## Known issues

- **Some names are displayed incorrectly.** Names with irregular capitalization (such as McDonald) or multiple parts (such as De Leon) lose this information in RPG Census. This is because of limitations in the published census data itself, which presents all names in upper case and without spaces.
- **The names are from an old census.** RPG Census uses data from the 1990 census, even though there have been two more censuses since then. This is because the 1990 census appears to be the latest census for which name statistics are publicly available online.
